          then they have copyright over their work. For example, writing a description
          or deciding whether or not to include some data in a dataset would require
          judgement. So contributors must transfer or waive their rights, or license
          the data to you before you can publish it.

          practice to explicitly state this by labelling it as ‘public domain’. You

        help_text: Remember that whoever spends intellectual effort creating content
          automatically gets rights over it but creative content does not include
          facts. So people need a waiver or a licence which proves that they can use
          the content and explains how they can do that legally. We list the most
          common licenses here; if there is no copyright in the content, it's expired,
          or you've waived them, choose 'Not applicable'.
